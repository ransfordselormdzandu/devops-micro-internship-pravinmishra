# Assignment 4 — Gotto Job: Backlog Refinement & Sprint 1 in Jira

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this 90-minute, time-boxed exercise, you will act as a Scrum team — or run in Solo Mode, playing every role yourself — to turn the Gotto Job template into a value-ordered backlog, estimate the work in story points, plan Sprint 1, open the burndown chart, and ship one small UI-only increment (text, color, spacing, a label, or a CTA — no backend changes).

---

# Task 1 — Roles & Mode Setup (Team vs Solo)

## Goal

Choose Team Mode or Solo Mode, and document how each Scrum role (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Lead, DevOps Lead) was handled.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Jira "Create project" screen, or the project sidebar after creation

### Notes

Write one line for each role: PO (what you prioritized), SM (how you ensured process), Dev Lead (what you built), DevOps Lead (how you shipped).

Scrum Roles and Responsibilities

In this sprint four distinct roles were identified and documented, each with a specific area of ownership:

Product Owner (PO) — Owns the backlog priority. Decides which Stories deliver the most value to the user or business and ranks them accordingly.

Scrum Master (SM) — Owns the process. Ensures sprint ceremonies are run correctly, timeboxes are respected and Scrum practices are followed throughout the sprint.

Dev Lead — Owns the implementation. Responsible for writing and delivering the actual code change for the selected Story.

DevOps Lead — Owns the delivery. Responsible for committing, deploying and verifying that the change is live in production.

Why This Matters?

Scrum is built on accountability. Each role exists to answer a specific question:

PO = What should we build and why?
Scrum Master = Are we following the right process?
Dev Lead = How do we build it?
DevOps Lead = How do we ship and verify it?

Even when working solo, documenting each role separately forces deliberate thinking about decisions from different perspectives (separating what has value, how it gets built and how it gets shipped) rather than treating all the work as one undifferentiated task.

# Task 2 — Create the Jira Project (Team-managed → Scrum)

## Goal

Create a Team-managed Scrum project named `Gotto Job – Team <#>` (Team Mode) or `Gotto Job – <YourName>` (Solo Mode).

### Evidence

# Task 3 — Create the Epic

## Goal

Create the Epic `Improve Gotto Job UI discoverability & trust` to group the UI improvement initiative.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Backlog showing the Epic panel with the Epic visible

# Task 4 — Seed the Product Backlog (6–8 Stories + Fibonacci Points + Ranking)

## Goal

Create at least six Stories under the Epic, estimate each with 1, 2, or 3 story points, and rank them by value.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Backlog showing the Epic and at least six Stories under it

#### Screenshot 5 — One Story opened showing its Story Points and acceptance criteria filled in

# Task 5 — Planning Poker (Estimate + Debate Notes)

## Goal

Confirm the Story Points (1, 2, or 3) for each Story and record brief reasoning for each estimate.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Backlog showing Story Points visible, or two or three Stories opened showing their points

---

### Notes

For each story, explain in one or two lines why it is a 1, 2, or 3 (mention any debate, even in Solo Mode).

### Story Point Estimates & Justifications

S1 – Hero Tagline (1 Point):
This task involves updating a single heading on the page, representing a minimal effort change with negligible technical complexity.

S2 – Button Colour (1 Point):
This requires updating global CSS styling to change the button color across the application. Although it impacts multiple UI elements, it remains a straightforward, low-effort style adjustment.

S3 – Job Card Typography (2 Points):
This story involves updating font sizes and weights on job cards, requiring additional verification across various screen sizes to prevent layout regressions.

S4 – REMOTE Badge (2 Points):
This task introduces a new visual badge alongside conditional rendering logic to display it exclusively for remote listings, elevating it beyond a simple static text update.

S5 – Posted on Date (1 Point):
This requires inserting a basic static text field onto the layout, involving minimal markup changes and no background logic.

S6 – Search Labels (2 Points):
Updating several search input labels and placeholder texts requires broader interface updates and thorough testing to ensure consistent rendering across forms.

S7 – Job Detail "Apply Now" Button (1 Point):
This task adds a standard call-to-action button linking to an email or placeholder URL, presenting no custom logic or technical risk.

S8 – Footer Trust Links (1 Point):
This involves adding static "About" and "Contact" navigation links to the footer, requiring a minor HTML adjustment with no complex dependencies.

# Task 6 — Sprint Planning: Create Sprint 1 + Sprint Goal + Scope

## Goal

Create Sprint 1, move three or four Stories into it (approximately 3–6 points), set the Sprint Goal, and break each selected Story into Build, Verify, Deploy, and Screenshot Sub-tasks.

### Evidence

# Task 7 — Reports: Open Burndown Chart

# Task 8 — Ship One Small Increment (Build + Deploy + Proof)

## Goal
