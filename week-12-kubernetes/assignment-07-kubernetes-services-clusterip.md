# Assignment 7 — Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this guided lab, you will create an internal ClusterIP Service for NGINX, call it by DNS and virtual IP, break and fix its selector, and prove readiness-aware endpoint routing.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy the Probed NGINX Workload

## Goal

Create two healthy, labeled NGINX Pods (readiness + liveness probes) as Service backends.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Two Ready Pods with labels and IPs

---

# Task 2 — Create and Inspect the ClusterIP Service

## Goal

Create `nginx-svc` (type `ClusterIP`, selector `app: nginx`, port 80) and inspect the Service, Endpoints, and EndpointSlices.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Service ClusterIP plus populated Endpoints and EndpointSlices

---

# Task 3 — Call the Service from a Client Pod

## Goal

Create a BusyBox `tester` Pod and call `nginx-svc` by short name, ClusterIP, and both short/FQDN via `nslookup`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Successful `wget` responses and `nslookup` output

# Task 4 — Break and Fix the Selector Contract

## Goal

Change the Service selector to `app: does-not-match`, confirm endpoints become empty and requests fail, then restore `app: nginx`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Empty endpoints during failure and restored endpoints after the fix

---

# Task 5 — Prove Readiness-Aware Routing

## Goal

Scale to one replica, apply a broken readiness patch, confirm the NotReady Pod is excluded from Service endpoints, then restore the healthy Deployment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — NotReady Pod with excluded endpoint, followed by restored endpoint membership

---

# Task 6 — Troubleshoot and Optionally Clean Up

## Goal

Verify the Service path, then optionally delete `tester` and `nginx-svc`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Final verification or optional cleanup output

### Notes

Write a short note describing what the lab demonstrated.

This lab demonstrated how **Kubernetes ClusterIP Services** provide stable internal communication between applications without relying on changing Pod IP addresses. I learned how Services use labels and selectors to identify Pods, while Kubernetes DNS enables service discovery. The lab also showed how incorrect Service selectors cause empty endpoints and connection failures, and how restoring the correct selectors re-establishes connectivity. Additionally, I learned how readiness probes ensure that only healthy, ready Pods receive Service traffic. Overall, the lab improved my understanding of Kubernetes networking, service discovery, and reliable internal communication between Pods.
